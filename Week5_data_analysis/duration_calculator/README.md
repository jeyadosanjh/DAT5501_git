# WEEK 5 DATA TYPES AND DATA ANALYSIS - DURATION CALCULATOR

## Overview
This week focused on practical data analysis in Python.  
I worked with real and synthetic datasets to practise cleaning data, creating visualisations, and building a small duration calculator tool.

## Files in this folder
- 'duration_calc.py' — functions to calculate the difference between the current date and the user input date and also random dates and the current date
- 'random_dates.csv' - dataset of random dates
- 'test_duration_calc.py' - unit testing of the duration calculator

## How to run the code
```bash
python Week5_data_analysis/duration_calculator/duration_calc.py
