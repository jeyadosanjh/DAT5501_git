# WEEK 5 DATA TYPES AND DATA ANALYSIS - US ELECTION

## Overview
This week focused on practical data analysis in Python.  
I worked with real and synthetic datasets to practise cleaning data, creating visualisations, and building a small duration calculator tool.

## Files in this folder
- 'us_election_histogram.py' — function plotting the histogram of fraction of votes
- 'US-2016-primary.csv' - the dataset of fraction of votes
- 'us_election_fraction_votes_histogram.png' - the histogram saved as a png
## How to run the code
```bash
python Week5_data_analysis/US_election/us_election_histogram.py
