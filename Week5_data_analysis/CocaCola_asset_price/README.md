# WEEK 5 DATA TYPES AND DATA ANALYSIS - COCA COLA ASSET PRICE

## Overview
This week focused on practical data analysis in Python.  
I worked with real and synthetic datasets to practise cleaning data, creating visualisations, and building a small duration calculator tool.

## Files in this folder
- 'cocacola_asset_price.py' — functions cleaning data, plotting the asset price against the date, plotting daily percentage change against date and calculating the standard deviation of the changes
- 'cocacola_closing_price.png' - the plot of the asset price against the date
- 'cocacola_data.csv' - the dataset containing the asset prices and dates

## How to run the code
```bash
python Week5_data_analysis/CocaCola_asset_price/cocacola_asset_price.py
