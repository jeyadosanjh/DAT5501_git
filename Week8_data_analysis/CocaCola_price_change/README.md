# WEEK 8 DATA ANALYSIS, QUALITY AND COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY - COCACOLA PRICE CHANGE
## Overview
This week extended the data analysis techniques to include model fitting and forecasting.  
I worked with a global sea level dataset and explored how different polynomial models fit the data and forecast future values.

## Files in this folder
- 'cocacola_asset_price.py' — copy of the functions that create dataset and plot the asset price against date
- 'cocacola_price_sorting.py' - functions that calculate the daily change in price, the time it takes to sort the change in price and plots the change in time against n (7->365)
- 'cocacola_percent_change.png' - plot of change in time against n

## How to run the code
```bash
python Week8_data_analysis/CocaCola_price_change/cocacola_price_sorting.py
