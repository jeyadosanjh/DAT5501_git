# WEEK 2 CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION - DATA PIPELINE ACTIVITY

## Overview
This week introduced testing and the CircleCi software for automated testing.
The aim was to run unit tests automatically on every push to GitHub, so that broken code is caught early.

## Files in this folder
- `synthetic_data.py` — creates synthetic linear data and includes a function to plot the results
- `synthetic_data.csv` — dataset generated by `synthetic_data.py`
- `synthetic_plot.png` — saved visualisation of the synthetic data and regression line
- `test_synthetic_data.py` — unit tests testing the synthetic data creation function

## How to run the code
```bash
python Week2_continuous_integration/data_pipeline_activity/synthetic_data.py
