# WEEK 2 CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION - BASIC TESTING

## Overview
This week introduced testing and the CircleCi software for automated testing.
The aim was to run unit tests automatically on every push to GitHub, so that broken code is caught early.

## Files in this folder
- 'basic_function.py' – simple example function used for testing
- 'test_basic_function.py' – unit tests for 'basic_function.py'

## How to run the code
```bash
python Week2_continuous_integration/basic_testing/basic_function.py
