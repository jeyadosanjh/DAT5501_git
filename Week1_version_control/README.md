#WEEK 1 VERSION CONTROL

## Overview
This week introduced Git and GitHub for version control.  
I learned how to track changes, create commits, push to a remote repository, and resolve simple issues with staging and history.

## Files in this folder
- `initial.py` — small Python script used to practise branching and committing
- `...` — add any additional practice files, notes, or examples used during the session

## How to run the script

From the repository root:

```bash
python Week1_version_control/initial.py
